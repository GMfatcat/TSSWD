<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## TSSWD
Taiwan SAR-based Ship and Weather Dataset (TSSWD) is the latest SAR ship dataset combined with weather data. [Link]() to the research paper.

Here's why you should use our dataset:
* Dataset build up with buoy weather data, i.e. every image has various weather data including **wave height**, **wind speed** ... etc. So not only the dataset can be use in Ship detection, it also got the potential to do sea weather prediction through SAR images!
* We only use Sentinel-1 as our image source, no mixed-source satellite, which is more common practice in Remote Sensing Field.
* The ship size in our dataset is smaller than previous dataset, which means it's more challenging :smile:
